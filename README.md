## 🧩 Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project employs a modular architecture, dividing functionality into distinct components such as update APIs, configuration management, and admin interfaces. This ensures maintainability and scalability. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The project adheres to coding standards, with clear organization of files and comprehensive inline comments. Security measures like input sanitization and IP blacklisting are integrated throughout the codebase. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | Includes configuration and setup guides, inline comments, and function documentation. The repository seems well-organized, but additional user-facing documentation could enhance accessibility. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | The project integrates with WordPress installations, leveraging external APIs for plugin and theme updates. Dependencies include authentication, WAF, and configuration libraries. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase exhibits high modularity, with distinct folders for configuration, MVC components (`app/Core`, `app/Controllers`, `app/Models`, `app/Views`), and public access points. Each module handles specific functionality, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The project is designed for efficiency, with secure download endpoints and optimized URL routing via `.htaccess`. However, explicit performance metrics and profiling data are not provided. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Implements robust security measures including IP blacklisting, authentication libraries, and input validation. Admin interface security is enhanced through session management and a web application firewall (WAF). |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | The project relies on standard libraries like authentication, WAF, configuration management, IP blacklisting, and Dropzone for dynamic file handling. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | Designed to handle increasing traffic with modular components for updates and management. However, explicit load testing data to back scalability claims is not available. |

## 🚀 Getting Started
**System Requirements:**

* **PHP**: version 7.4 or higher
* **Web Server**: Apache, Nginx or any server capable of running PHP
* **Write Permissions**: ensure the web server can write to `update-api/storage`

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository inside your web server document root.
2. Create the following directories so the Update API can store packages and logs:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p update-api/storage/plugins
   mkdir -p update-api/storage/themes
   mkdir -p update-api/storage/logs
   ```
3. Edit `update-api/config.php` and set the login credentials and directory constants. Adjust `VALID_USERNAME`, `VALID_PASSWORD`, and paths under `BASE_DIR` if the defaults do not match your setup.
4. Define the API constants used by the mu-plugins in your WordPress `wp-config.php`:

   ```php
   define('VONTMENT_KEY', 'your-api-key');
   define('VONTMENT_PLUGINS', 'https://example.com/update-api/public/api');
   define('VONTMENT_THEMES', 'https://example.com/update-api/public/api');
   ```
5. Ensure the web server user owns the `update-api/storage` directory so uploads and logs can be written.

### 🤖 Usage

1. Copy the files from the repository's `mu-plugin/` folder into your WordPress installation's `wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. WordPress automatically loads any PHP files placed here.
2. Log in to the Update API by visiting the `/login` route (handled by `index.php`) using the credentials configured in `config.php` to manage hosts, plugins and themes.
